# Lab 08 - Configure Audio Conferencing

If you remember the lesson, Dedicated phone numbers are those phone numbers that are only available to users within your organization. You can also change the languages that are used when someone calls in to one of these numbers.  

In this lab, you will obtain a new service phone number from Microsoft 365, then configure a dedicated conference bridge phone number and make it the default conferencing number for Contoso.  In the second exercise, you will apply it to a single user.  

>[!Note] This lab will focus on using service numbers from Microsoft 365.  The process is a bit different if you are transferring a number from your existing PSTN provider.  Contact Microsoft support for more information on the process to transfer a service number to Microsoft 365.

#### Exercise #2 - Modifying a User's Audio Conferencing Settings

In this lab, User Amy Alberts, who is your VP of Human Resources has asked to use a local number for Audio Conferencing.  You have already acquired the number in the previous exercise.  Your security team has also requested that you restrict dial-out settings from audio conferences to just domestic numbers.  

Also, in order to save time, we will assume that the user is already licensed for Audio Conferencing before continuing on with the next step.
